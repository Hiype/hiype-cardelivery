Follow the objective, use any lockpick to open the car and hotwire if necessary.<br>
Drive to the destination. Beware, if the car is destroyed, job will **fail**!<br>
Once you arrive at the destination, stop the car inside the objective blip on mini map. Job will finish and you will get paid depending on distance driven and condition of the car.
